# Anomalies

Anomalies, also known as outliers or exceptions, are data points that deviate significantly from the normal or expected behavior in a dataset. These data points can occur due to errors in data collection, measurement, or entry, or they may represent legitimate exceptions to the general trends in the data. In machine learning, anomalies can have a significant impact on model performance, as they may skew the results or lead to false conclusions.

There are two main types of anomalies:

1. Point anomalies: a single instance of data that is significantly different from other instances.
2. Contextual anomalies: an instance of data that is normal in a certain context but abnormal in another.

There are several techniques for detecting anomalies in data and machine learning, including:

1. Statistical methods: using measures such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles to identify data points that fall outside a certain range.
2. Clustering methods: grouping data points into clusters and identifying points that do not belong to any cluster.
3. Distance-based methods: computing the distance between data points and identifying points that are far away from the others.
4. Density-based methods: identifying areas in the data where the density is significantly lower than the surrounding areas.
5. Machine learning-based methods: using algorithms such as neural networks or decision trees to learn the normal behavior of the data and identify points that deviate from it.

Once the anomalies are identified, data scientist can either remove them from the dataset, or if the anomalies are relevant, use them separately for specific tasks such as fraud detection or rare event prediction.
