# BONUS: The Orijin of Algorithm

Algorithm names come from the work of the Persian mathematician and astronomer Al-Khwarizmi, who lived in the 9th century AD. Al-Khwarizmi was a key figure in the development of mathematics and algorithms in the Islamic Golden Age, and his work had a significant impact on the development of mathematics and science in the centuries that followed.

One example of an algorithm named after Al-Khwarizmi is the "Euclidean Algorithm", which is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two or more integers. The algorithm is attributed to Al-Khwarizmi and it's known as "Euclidean Algorithm" because the Greek mathematician Euclid described it in his book "Elements" centuries before.

Another example is the "Algorithm" itself, which comes from the Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name, "al-Khwarizmi". The word "algorithm" is used to refer to a set of instructions for solving a specific problem, and it is derived from the name of the mathematician and astronomer who made significant contributions to the development of algorithms and mathematics.

In summary, Al-Khwarizmi was a major figure in the development of mathematics and algorithms, and his work has had a lasting impact on the field. Some algorithm names are directly derived from his name, such as the "Euclidean Algorithm" and "Algorithm" itself, while others are inspired by his work and contributions to the field.
