A data type is a classification of types of data that determines the types of operations that can be performed on that data. Common data types include:

- Integer: a whole number, such as 3 or -5
- Floating-point: a number with a decimal point, such as 3.14 or -1.6
- Boolean: a true or false value
- String: a sequence of characters, such as "hello" or "goodbye"
- Array: a collection of multiple values, usually of the same data type
- Object: a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value can be of any data type.

Different programming languages may have different sets of data types, and may provide additional ways to define and manipulate data types.
