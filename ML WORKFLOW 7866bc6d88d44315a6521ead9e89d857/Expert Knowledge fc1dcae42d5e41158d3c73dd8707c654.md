# Expert Knowledge

In the context of algorithm selection, expert knowledge is the use of the knowledge and experience of experts in the field of machine learning to select the appropriate algorithm for a specific problem.

Expert knowledge can be used to select an algorithm by taking into account the characteristics of the problem and the data, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms. For example, an expert in machine learning may use their knowledge and experience to determine that a specific algorithm is well-suited for a particular type of problem, or that another algorithm is not appropriate for a specific problem due to its limitations.

The advantage of using expert knowledge for algorithm selection is that it allows for a more informed decision to be made, taking into account the specific characteristics of the problem and the data. However, the use of expert knowledge is often subjective, and it can be influenced by the expert's personal experience and biases. It's also important to keep in mind that expert knowledge can be limited by the current state of the field and the information available, it may not take into account the latest research or the new algorithms that have been developed.
