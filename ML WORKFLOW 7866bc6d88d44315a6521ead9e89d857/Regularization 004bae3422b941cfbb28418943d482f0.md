# Regularization

Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, but performs poorly on new, unseen data.

Regularization adds a term to the loss function that discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any one feature. The most common types of regularization are:

1. L1 regularization (also known as Lasso regularization) adds the absolute value of the weights to the loss function. This causes some weights to become exactly zero, effectively removing those features from the model.
2. L2 regularization (also known as Ridge regularization) adds the square of the weights to the loss function. This causes all weights to be small, but unlike L1 regularization, it doesn't cause any weights to become exactly zero.
3. Elastic Net regularization is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization.

Regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, often represented by lambda (Î») and when it is added to the loss function it is multiplied by this hyperparameter. This value can be adjusted to find the best trade-off between fitting the training data well and avoiding overfitting.

Regularization is especially useful when the number of features is large or when the model is complex, as it can help simplify the model and make it more robust. Regularization is a powerful technique that can improve the performance of a model and make it more generalizable to new, unseen data.
