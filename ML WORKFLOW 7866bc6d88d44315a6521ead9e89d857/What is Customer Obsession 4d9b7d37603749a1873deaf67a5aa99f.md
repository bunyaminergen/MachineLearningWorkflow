# What is Customer Obsession

"Customer obsession" is a term often used in business to describe a focus on understanding and meeting the needs of customers. In the context of machine learning, customer obsession concerns refer to the ways in which a machine learning model or system may not fully meet the needs of its intended users or customers. Some examples of customer obsession concerns in machine learning include:

- Lack of user-centered design: The model or system may not have been developed with a deep understanding of the user's needs, goals, and context of use.
- Lack of interpretability: The model may be difficult to understand or explain to users, making it hard for them to trust and use the predictions.
- Lack of fairness and bias: The model may be unfair or biased, which can lead to poor predictions for certain groups of users or customers.
- Lack of transparency: The model may be opaque, making it hard for users or customers to understand how it is making predictions.
- Lack of privacy: The model may collect or use data in a way that is not transparent or respectful of users' privacy.

Addressing these concerns is important for building trust and adoption of machine learning models and systems among customers. One way to do this is by involving customers in the design and development process, and testing the model with them to ensure it meets their needs. Additionally, implementing transparency and interpretability techniques, as well as fair, explainable and ethical AI methods can help to mitigate these concerns.
