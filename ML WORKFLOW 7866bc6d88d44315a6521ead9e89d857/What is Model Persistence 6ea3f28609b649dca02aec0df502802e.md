# What is Model Persistence

Model persistence refers to the ability to save a trained machine learning model to a file and load it again later in order to make predictions. This allows you to save the time and computational resources required to retrain the model. Model persistence also allows you to share your trained model with others, so they can use it to make predictions without having to retrain it themselves.

There are several ways to persist a machine learning model, such as:

- Serializing the model object to a file using pickle in python or joblib library
- Saving the model's architecture and weights separately using libraries like Tensorflow or Pytorch.
- Saving the model in a format that can be loaded by other machine learning frameworks such as ONNX, PMML.

By using model persistence, you can save the state of your model, so you can continue working on it later. You can also share your model with others, so they can use it to make predictions without having to retrain it themselves.
