# What is Model Versioning

Model versioning refers to the practice of keeping multiple versions of a machine learning model, so that you can roll back to a previous version if necessary, or compare the performance of different versions.

Model versioning can be useful in several ways. For example:

- You can use it to track the performance of a model over time, and compare it to previous versions to see if it's improving or degrading.
- You can use it to roll back to a previous version if the current version is performing poorly or has bugs.
- You can use it to compare the performance of different versions of a model, to determine which version is the best.
- You can use it to check the impact of different data, feature, or architecture changes on the model.

There are several tools and techniques available for versioning machine learning models, such as:

- Git: using git to version control the code and the model artifacts
- Model management platforms like MLflow, DataRobot
- Cloud-based ML model management services like AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud ML Engine.

By versioning your machine learning models, you can ensure that you can always go back to a previous version of a model if necessary, and that you can compare the performance of different versions to determine which one is the best. This can help to improve the reliability, stability, and performance of your models over time.
