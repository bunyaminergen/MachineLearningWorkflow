# **What is** White Paper

A white paper is a formal document that outlines a company or organization's view or plan on a particular topic, often used to introduce a new product, service or propose a solution to a problem.

White papers are often used to launch a previously announced product or service or to propose a solution to a problem. A white paper is similar to a research paper in length, detail, and technical descriptions, but its purpose is more focused on presenting a proposed solution or idea. White papers are typically published in a professional environment in the business or policy realm and are often written to help readers gain knowledge of a specific issue or industry.

- White papers are typically written by subject matter experts within a company or organization, or by third-party consultants who are hired to provide their expertise on a particular topic.
- They often present data, research, and expert opinions to support the proposed solution or idea.
- White papers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as generating leads, establishing thought leadership, or influencing policy or decision-making.
- They are usually longer than traditional marketing materials, such as brochures or product descriptions, and can range from a few pages to over a hundred pages in length.
- White papers may include technical details, diagrams, and charts to help explain complex concepts or solutions.
- They are often used in industries such as technology, finance, healthcare, and government, but can be applied to any field where a company or organization wants to present its expertise on a particular issue.
- White papers can be distributed in various formats, such as PDFs, ebooks, or online articles, and are often gated behind a form that readers must fill out before accessing the document.
- White papers are generally considered a form of content marketing, as they aim to provide value to the reader by educating them on a particular topic, rather than promoting a specific product or service.
