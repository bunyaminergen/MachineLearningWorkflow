# Code for Model Parallelism

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the model
model = nn.Sequential(
nn.Linear(100, 200),
nn.ReLU(),
nn.Linear(200, 300),
nn.ReLU(),
nn.Linear(300, 400),
nn.ReLU(),
nn.Linear(400, 500),
nn.ReLU(),
nn.Linear(500, 600),
nn.ReLU()
)

# Split the model across multiple GPUs
model1 = nn.Sequential(model[:5])
model2 = nn.Sequential(model[5:])

# Move the models to the corresponding GPUs
model1 = model1.to(device1)
model2 = model2.to(device2)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criter
ion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the model
for inputs, labels in dataset:
optimizer.zero_grad()

# Forward pass through the first part of the model on GPU1
outputs1 = model1(inputs)

# Forward pass through the second part of the model on GPU2
outputs2 = model2(outputs1)
loss = criterion(outputs2, labels)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

The final output will be computed on GPU2
This example demonstrates a basic im
plementation of model parallelism in PyTorch. It splits a large model into
two smaller sub models, and assigns each one to a different GPU. The input data is passed through the first sub
model on GPU1, and then passed to the second sub model on GPU2 for fu rther processing. In this way, the memory
of each GPU is used efficiently and the model can be trained on larger datasets and achieve better performance.
It's worth noting that this is a simple example and in practice the implementation may vary depending on the
specific requirements of the project and the resources available. Also, in this example the model is split across two
devices, however, the same co ncept can be applied to split the model across multiple devices.
