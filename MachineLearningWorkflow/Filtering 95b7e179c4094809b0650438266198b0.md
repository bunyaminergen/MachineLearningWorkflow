# Filtering

Filtering refers to the process of selecting a subset of the features in a dataset based on certain criteria. The goal of filtering is to identify and select the most informative or relevant features for a specific task, in order to improve the performance of machine learning models.

There are several types of feature filtering methods, including:

1. Correlation based filtering: This method selects features based on their correlation with the target variable. Features that have a high correlation with the target variable are considered informative and are selected.
2. Mutual information based filtering: This method selects features based on the mutual information between the feature and the target variable. Features that have a high mutual information with the target variable are considered informative and are selected.
3. Lasso regularization: This method is a linear model that uses L1 regularization to shrink the coefficient of less important features to zero.
4. Recursive feature elimination (RFE): This method recursively removes features by training a model with a subset of the features, and then using the model to evaluate the importance of the features. The least important features are removed and the process is repeated until a desired number of features is reached.
5. Feature Importance from tree-based models: models such as Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM have in-built feature importance calculations, which can be used to identify the most important features for the task.

It's important to note that feature filtering is dependent on the specific problem and dataset, and that it's important to evaluate the trade-off between the number of features and the model's performance. Also, it's important to keep in mind that filtering is not always necessary and it's important to evaluate the performance of the model with and without filtering to decide whether it's beneficial or not.
