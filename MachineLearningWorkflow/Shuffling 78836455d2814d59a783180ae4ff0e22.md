# Shuffling

Shuffling is the process of randomly reordering a dataset. In the context of model validation, shuffling is often used to randomize the order of the samples in the dataset before splitting it into training and test sets. Shuffling is used to ensure that the samples in the training and test sets are not ordered in a way that may bias the evaluation of the model. For example, if the samples are ordered by class label, and the model is trained and evaluated on a dataset where all the samples of one class are together, the model may perform poorly on unseen samples of that class. By shuffling the samples before splitting them into train and test sets, this bias is avoided.

Shuffling can be done in multiple ways, such as randomly selecting the data points and then mixing them, or using a specific algorithm like Fisher-Yates shuffle. It is important to shuffle the data before splitting it into training and test sets so that the model can learn from a diverse set of examples.

There are several methods for shuffling data, some of the common ones are:

1. Random permutation: This method involves generating a random permutation of the indices of the samples in the dataset, and then using these indices to reorder the samples. This can be done using a random number generator or a built-in function like numpy.random.permutation in python.
2. Fisher-Yates shuffle: This method is an algorithm that generates a random permutation of the elements in an array by repeatedly swapping two randomly chosen elements. It is considered a "true" random shuffle and can be implemented in a variety of programming languages.
3. Reservoir sampling: This method is used to randomly select a fixed number of elements from a large dataset. It is an efficient method when the dataset is too large to fit into memory.
4. Block Shuffling: This method is used when the data is already divided into blocks, for example if data is time series data, this method is used to shuffle the blocks of data.
5. Stratified sampling: This method is used when the dataset is imbalanced, meaning that it contains different number of samples from each class. It involves randomly shuffling the data while maintaining the proportion of samples from each class.
6. Smart Shuffling: This method is used when the data has a specific structure and we want to maintain that structure during shuffling.

The choice of the method depends on the specific problem, the dataset, and the research goals, for example if the data is too large to fit in memory, reservoir sampling is more efficient than Fisher-Yates shuffle.
