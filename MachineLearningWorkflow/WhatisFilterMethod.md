# What is Filter Method

Filter methods are a type of feature selection technique that use a statistical measure to evaluate the importance of each feature in the dataset. These methods are called filter methods because they filter out the less important features, leaving only the most relevant ones. Filter methods are typically faster than wrapper methods and can be used as a preprocessing step before applying a more computationally expensive feature selection method.

Some examples of filter methods include:

1. Chi-squared test: This method uses a chi-squared statistical test to evaluate the dependence between each feature and the target variable. It is often used for categorical data.
2. ANOVA: This method uses analysis of variance to evaluate the relationship between each feature and the target variable. It is often used for continuous data.
3. Correlation-based feature selection: This method uses measures of correlation, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient, to evaluate the linear relationship between each feature and the target variable.
4. Mutual information based feature selection: This method uses mutual information to evaluate the relationship between each feature and the target variable.
5. Information gain: This method uses information theory to evaluate the reduction in entropy caused by each feature.

Filter methods are simple and easy to implement, and they can be useful in cases where the dataset is large and the number of features is high. They are also useful in situations where the interpretability of the model is important. However, they can be sensitive to correlated features and may not always select the best features for a given model.
