# What is Loss function

A loss function is a function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output of a model. The goal of training a machine learning model is to find the best set of parameters that minimize the loss function. The choice of loss function depends on the type of problem that the model is trying to solve.

For example:

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is commonly used for regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous value.
2. Cross-Entropy Loss (CEL) is commonly used for classification problems, where the goal is to predict a probability distribution over a set of classes.
3. Hinge loss is commonly used for Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification problem.

During the training process, the model's parameters are updated in order to minimize the loss function. The optimization algorithm used to update the model's parameters, such as gradient descent, uses the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters to determine the direction in which to update the parameters.

It is important to note that the choice of loss function should be relevant to the problem and the model you are working with. Choosing an appropriate loss function is crucial for the model to learn effectively.
