# Business

A business goal is a specific and measurable outcome that a company or organization aims 
to achieve within a certain timeframe to improve its operations, increase revenue, 
or achieve a competitive advantage in the market.

The main aim of a business goal is to solve a particular problem that will benefit a company or organization. 
The goal is usually related to optimizing a process, improving efficiency, reducing costs, increasing revenue, 
or enhancing customer experience. A business goal should be well-defined and measurable, so it can be evaluated 
in terms of success or failure. For instance, a business goal could be to predict customer churn rate 
to reduce customer loss and increase customer retention.

Questions to ask when setting a Business Goal:

- What specific problem does the business want to solve with machine learning?
- How will the machine learning solution benefit the business?
- What data sources are available or needed to accomplish the goal?
- What are the expected costs and benefits of the project? 
- How will the success of the project be measured?

Overall, Business goals in a Machine Learning Project is crucial for ensuring that the project is focused on solving 
specific problems that will benefit the organization. The goal should be well-defined and measurable, 
with a clear objective of optimizing processes, reducing costs, increasing revenue, or enhancing customer experience. 
By answering critical questions such as what problem the business wants to solve, how the machine learning solution 
will benefit the business, and what specific outcomes or results the business hopes to achieve, the project will be 
aligned with the overall objectives of the organization, and the machine learning model will provide practical 
and valuable insights.

# Methods of Business Goals

- [Customer Obsession](MachineLearningWorkflow/pages/CustomerObsession.md): As you mentioned, customer obsession can be a valuable concept to consider. This means placing the customer at the center of the project and focusing on delivering a solution that meets their needs and expectations.

- [Feasibility](MachineLearningWorkflow/pages/Feasibility.md): The objective should be technically feasible given the resources and technology available. The project team should have the necessary skills and expertise to deliver the solution.

- [ROI](MachineLearningWorkflow/pages/ROI.md): The return on investment (ROI) should also be considered. The objective should be realistic and achievable within the budget and time constraints of the project.

- **Measurability**: Goals should be measurable so that progress can be tracked and success can be determined. This could involve defining specific metrics or key performance indicators [KPIs](MachineLearningWorkflow/pages/KPIs.md)

- **Alignment**: Business goals should be aligned with the goals and objectives of other departments and teams within the organization. This can ensure that everyone is working towards a common purpose.

- **Flexibility**: Business goals should be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. This can involve revising goals as necessary to account for unexpected events or new opportunities.

- **Time-bound**: Goals should be time-bound with a specific deadline for achievement. This can help create a sense of urgency and motivate the team to work towards the goal.
