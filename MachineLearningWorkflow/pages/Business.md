# Business

A business goal is a specific and measurable outcome that a company or organization aims 
to achieve within a certain timeframe to improve its operations, increase revenue, 
or achieve a competitive advantage in the market.

The main aim of a business goal is to solve a particular problem that will benefit a company or organization. 
The goal is usually related to optimizing a process, improving efficiency, reducing costs, increasing revenue, 
or enhancing customer experience. A business goal should be well-defined and measurable, so it can be evaluated 
in terms of success or failure. For instance, a business goal could be to predict customer churn rate 
to reduce customer loss and increase customer retention.

Questions to ask when setting a Business Goal:

- What specific problem does the business want to solve with machine learning?
- How will the machine learning solution benefit the business?
- What data sources are available or needed to accomplish the goal?
- What are the expected costs and benefits of the project? 
- How will the success of the project be measured?

Overall, Business goals in a Machine Learning Project is crucial for ensuring that the project is focused on solving 
specific problems that will benefit the organization. The goal should be well-defined and measurable, 
with a clear objective of optimizing processes, reducing costs, increasing revenue, or enhancing customer experience. 
By answering critical questions such as what problem the business wants to solve, how the machine learning solution 
will benefit the business, and what specific outcomes or results the business hopes to achieve, the project will be 
aligned with the overall objectives of the organization, and the machine learning model will provide practical 
and valuable insights.
