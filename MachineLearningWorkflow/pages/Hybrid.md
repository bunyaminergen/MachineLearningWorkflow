# Hybrid


A hybrid goal combines elements of both business and research goals to solve a real-world problem while 
also exploring new knowledge or insights.

Hybrid goals are common in academic-industry collaborations or startup companies. 
The goal could be to develop a new machine learning model that solves a specific problem 
while also improving the state-of-the-art. For instance, a hybrid goal could be to develop a new fraud detection model 
that outperforms existing models while also exploring new techniques for anomaly detection.

Questions to ask when setting a Hybrid Goal:

- What is the specific problem that needs to be solved? 
- How will the machine learning solution benefit the business or industry? 
- What new knowledge or insights can be gained through the project? 
- What are the metrics to measure the success of the project in terms of both business and research goals?
- What are the potential risks or trade-offs involved in pursuing a hybrid goal, and how can they be addressed?

Overall, a hybrid goal in a machine learning project aims to solve a real-world problem while also 
exploring new knowledge or insights. This type of goal is often seen in academic-industry collaborations 
or startup companies. The success of a hybrid goal is measured by both the improvement of the current state-of-the-art 
and the benefit it provides to the business or industry. When setting a hybrid goal, it is important to consider 
the specific problem to be solved, the potential benefits of the machine learning solution, the new insights or 
knowledge to be gained, and the metrics to measure success in terms of both business and research goals. 
Incorporating the latest research findings into the project can also be an important consideration for achieving 
a successful hybrid goal.
