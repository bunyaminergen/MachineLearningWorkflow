# Research

A research goal aims to explore and gain new knowledge or insights about a particular subject.

The main objective of a research goal is to explore and gain new knowledge or insights about a particular subject. 
Research goals are more open-ended and less focused on solving a specific problem compared to business goals. 
The goal could be to develop a new algorithm or model or to explore a new dataset. 
The success of a research goal is usually measured by the novelty and usefulness of the findings.

In an academic-industrial research collaboration, the goal could be to investigate the underlying causes and mechanisms 
of a particular disease to develop a new treatment or diagnostic method. The research goal could involve exploring 
new datasets or developing new algorithms to analyze complex biological data. The success of the research goal could be 
measured by the discovery of new biomarkers or therapeutic targets, or the development of more accurate 
diagnostic or prognostic tools.

Questions to ask when setting a Research Goal:

- What is the research question that needs to be answered? 
- How will the machine learning solution contribute to the existing knowledge? 
- What are the metrics to measure the novelty and usefulness of the findings?
- What data sources or datasets will be used for the research? 
- What are the potential limitations or challenges that need to be addressed?

Overall, the research goal should be focused on advancing the state-of-the-art and contributing new knowledge 
to the field, while also considering the potential practical applications and benefits of the research findings.

# Methods of Research

- Research Design: This involves selecting an appropriate research design or approach, such as experimental, correlational, 
or qualitative research methods.

- Ethical Considerations: Researchers must consider ethical issues related to the research project, such as obtaining informed consent from participants, protecting their confidentiality and privacy, and ensuring that the research is conducted in an ethical and responsible manner.

- Validity and Reliability: Researchers must consider the validity and reliability of their research findings, ensuring that their results accurately reflect the phenomenon being studied and are consistent across different data sources or samples.

- Dissemination: Finally, researchers must consider how they will disseminate their findings to relevant audiences, such as academic journals, conferences, or stakeholders in the field.
