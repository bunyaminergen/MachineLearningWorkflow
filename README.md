# What is Machine Learning Workflow

The machine learning workflow is a crucial process in developing machine learning models.
I have examined various machine learning workflows and incorporated the latest updates to create a custom workflow. 
This workflow is continually being updated with new topics and information to ensure it remains relevant.

The workflow consists of seven main steps:



1. Goal
2. Learning
3. Data
4. Data Process
5. Feature Engineering 
6. Model
7. Goal Evaluation

To make the workflow easier to follow, I have created a diagram that outlines each step of the process. Additionally, I have included guiding questions to help users understand each step and ensure they are on the right track.

Finally, users can access detailed pages for each topic covered in the workflow. This enables them to delve deeper into each topic and gain a more thorough understanding of the entire process.

Overall, this machine learning workflow provides a comprehensive guide for users to develop effective machine learning models. By following this workflow, users can be confident in their ability to create accurate and efficient models.

# How to use

1. Questions:

When developing a machine learning project, it can be more beneficial and practical to use the workflow diagram or guiding questions. It can be overwhelming to dive deep into every topic all at once.

After deciding to start a machine learning project, you can move on to the guided questions section and answer each question in sequence. The guided questions section will look like this:

- What is your goal? <br>
\- Diabete predict <br>
- What is type of goal ? <br>
\- Research <br>
- What is the learning type? <br>
\- Supervised <br>
- Do you have data? <br>
\- No <br>
\- Get data or <br>
\- collect data <br>
...<br>
and so on.<br>

By answering each question in sequence, you can develop a clear understanding of the goals and needs of your project. This approach can help you stay on track and avoid becoming overwhelmed by the various topics involved in machine learning. Overall, using the workflow diagram or guided questions can make the process of developing a machine learning project more manageable and efficient.

2. Diagrams

Instead of using guiding questions, you may prefer to use a diagram to visualize the workflow. The diagram will be similar to the questions, but it presents the information in a more visual way. Diagrams can be more memorable and easier to understand because of their visual nature. Additionally, one advantage of a diagram is that it enables users to return to previous steps if necessary.

We are considering two approaches for creating a diagram: static and dynamic. The static diagram will include general headings, such as the seven main steps in the workflow. The dynamic diagram, on the other hand, will be shaped by the project or user and will include questions similar to those in the guided questions section.

Using a diagram can make it easier to understand and follow the workflow. The static diagram provides a general overview of the workflow, while the dynamic diagram can be customized to fit the needs of the specific project or user. Ultimately, the choice between the two approaches will depend on the user's preferences and the specific project's requirements.

Dynamic Workflow Diagram:

For example, after you determine your goal, when you click on the "Type of goal" option, 
the dynamic diagram will change and the next step will appear.
You can click and read the content of the step that you do not understand or do not know.
In fact, in the "How to Use" section, we advise you not to dive deep into all the topics, 
as it may cause you to lose your way. 
Instead, we recommend that you identify your project goals and follow the steps accordingly.

# Machine Learning Workflow


# Goal

The Goal section of a Machine Learning Workflow Project is crucial as it sets the direction for the entire project. 
The main objective of the Goal section is to define the problem statement that needs to be solved through 
machine learning and the expected outcome of the project.

Questions to ask when setting a Goal:

-	What is the main problem the trying to solve?
-	What specific outcome or result do we want to achieve through this project?
-	Are there alternative methods or approaches to solving this problem, and is the machine learning the best option?
-	What data and resources do we need to gather and analyze to achieve our goal?
-	How will we measure the success of this project, and what metrics will we use to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning model?

It is important to clearly define the goal of a machine learning project and consider the subtopics of 
Business, Research, and Hybrid to ensure that the project is focused and aligned with the desired outcomes. 
The goal should be measurable, realistic, and have a clear impact on the organization or industry.

In summary, The Goal of a Machine Learning Project should clearly define the problem statement and the expected outcome. 
Asking the right questions can help to find the right goals and set the project in the right direction.
There are three subtopics to consider when defining the goal of a machine learning project: Business, Research, and Hybrid.

- ### Business:

The main aim of a business goal is to solve a particular problem that will benefit a company or organization. 
The goal is usually related to optimizing a process, improving efficiency, reducing costs, increasing revenue, 
or enhancing customer experience. A business goal should be well-defined and measurable, so it can be evaluated 
in terms of success or failure. For instance, a business goal could be to predict customer churn rate to reduce 
customer loss and increase customer retention.

Questions to ask when setting a Business Goal:

- What specific problem does the business want to solve with machine learning? 
- How will the machine learning solution benefit the business? 
- What data sources are available or needed to accomplish the goal? 
- What are the expected costs and benefits of the project? 
- How will the success of the project be measured?

Overall, Business goals in a Machine Learning Project is crucial for ensuring that the project is focused on 
solving specific problems that will benefit the organization. The goal should be well-defined and measurable, 
with a clear objective of optimizing processes, reducing costs, increasing revenue, or enhancing customer experience. 
By answering critical questions such as what problem the business wants to solve, how the machine learning solution will 
benefit the business, and what specific outcomes or results the business hopes to achieve, the project will be 
aligned with the overall objectives of the organization, and the machine learning model will provide practical 
and valuable insights.

- ### Research:

The main objective of a research goal is to explore and gain new knowledge or insights about a particular subject. 
Research goals are more open-ended and less focused on solving a specific problem compared to business goals. 
The goal could be to develop a new algorithm or model or to explore a new dataset. 
The success of a research goal is usually measured by the novelty and usefulness of the findings.

In an academic-industrial research collaboration, the goal could be to investigate the underlying causes and mechanisms 
of a particular disease to develop a new treatment or diagnostic method. The research goal could involve exploring 
new datasets or developing new algorithms to analyze complex biological data. The success of the research goal could be 
measured by the discovery of new biomarkers or therapeutic targets, or the development of more accurate 
diagnostic or prognostic tools.

Questions to ask when setting a Research Goal:

- What is the research question that needs to be answered? 
- How will the machine learning solution contribute to the existing knowledge? 
- What are the metrics to measure the novelty and usefulness of the findings?
- What data sources or datasets will be used for the research? 
- What are the potential limitations or challenges that need to be addressed?

Overall, the research goal should be focused on advancing the state-of-the-art and contributing new knowledge 
to the field, while also considering the potential practical applications and benefits of the research findings.

- ### Hybrid:

A hybrid goal combines elements of both business and research goals. 
The objective is to solve a real-world problem while also exploring new knowledge or insights. 
Hybrid goals are common in academic-industry collaborations or startup companies. 
The goal could be to develop a new machine learning model that solves a specific problem 
while also improving the state-of-the-art. For instance, a hybrid goal could be to develop a new fraud detection model 
that outperforms existing models while also exploring new techniques for anomaly detection.

Questions to ask when setting a Hybrid Goal:

- What is the specific problem that needs to be solved? 
- How will the machine learning solution benefit the business or industry? 
- What new knowledge or insights can be gained through the project? 
- What are the metrics to measure the success of the project in terms of both business and research goals?
- What are the potential risks or trade-offs involved in pursuing a hybrid goal, and how can they be addressed?

Overall, a hybrid goal in a machine learning project aims to solve a real-world problem while also 
exploring new knowledge or insights. This type of goal is often seen in academic-industry collaborations 
or startup companies. The success of a hybrid goal is measured by both the improvement of the current state-of-the-art 
and the benefit it provides to the business or industry. When setting a hybrid goal, it is important to consider 
the specific problem to be solved, the potential benefits of the machine learning solution, the new insights or 
knowledge to be gained, and the metrics to measure success in terms of both business and research goals. 
Incorporating the latest research findings into the project can also be an important consideration for achieving 
a successful hybrid goal.
